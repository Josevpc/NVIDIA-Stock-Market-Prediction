# 📈 NVIDIA Stock Market Prediction

This project aims to predict NVIDIA stock data using the yfinance Python library, with features based on market values. By applying machine learning techniques, it's possible to predict whether the stock price will increase. This type of prediction can assist buyers, sellers, and professionals in making better-informed financial decisions.

## 🔍 About the Project

The stock market is complex and, in some cases, quite challenging. This project leverages historical data from the yfinance library to build a Random Forest Classifier that predicts whether NVIDIA stock will increase or decrease in value. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and backtesting.

Main goals:

- Build a model to predict increases and decreases in NVIDIA stock;
- Learn more about the stock market and how machine learning can be applied to it.

## 📅 Future Steps

- [ ] Correlate other exchanges with the S&P 500 to enhance prediction accuracy;
- [ ] Add further data segmentation based on time intervals;
- [ ] Incorporate sentiment analysis from news, articles, and general statistics;
- [ ] Integrate key components, stocks, and sectors (e.g., if the tech sector is in a downturn, this may affect future performance in 6 months);
